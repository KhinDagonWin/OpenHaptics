# OpenHaptics
These are samples from OpenHaptics that I have tried using the Sensable Phantom Omni.

Before trying this, please download the OpenHaptics SDKs from the official website: OpenHaptics for Windows Developer Edition v3.5.

Set up the required environment variables and project links as specified.

For this project, I used Visual Studio 2019 (MSVC 2017).

Please be sure you have already linked all you need to your project.


This project is for the cannedforceeffect from the sample of OpenHaptics.
